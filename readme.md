# INTRODUCTION


This repository is the project of the Course 3: "Getting and Cleaning Data" from the Data Science Specialization.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.



## CONTENT

This repository contains following files:

    1) README.md This explains the contents of this repository and the files.
    2) a link to a Github repository with  script for performing the analysis.
    3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
    4) the tidyMeanDataset.csv and tidyMeanDataset.txt is a tidy data set that has the mean and standard deviation for each measurments. Content of both files are same.
    5) run_analysis.R file that performs the following tasks:
        i) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    	ii) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    	iii) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    	iv) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    	v) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
